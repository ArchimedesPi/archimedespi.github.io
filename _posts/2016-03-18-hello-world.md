title: hello world

hey, i'm liam.
the world is pretty cool. i sometimes have ideas about the world which i think are worth sharing; so here's a place to do that.

anyway, i set this up, probably won't dump too much on it but it's still fun :)
this whole site is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a pretty awesome static site generator.
i've pushed the files making up the jekyll site to github pages, which runs jekyll over them and then serves the output.
this is awesome since i can write my posts in markdown and `git push` to publish, which also, weirdly, removes inhibitions i might have with something like wordpress: just pop open vim, write a post, and `git push`.
the color scheme for the site is shamelessly ripped off from the awesome [zenburn](https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn) color scheme for vim, because super dark contrasty color schemes are wonderful.
